## Installation
Using packer
```

```

		list_head = "## ",
	}
})
```

With the above settings, you can manage tasks as follows

```
.
└── kanban.md
    └── tasks           # Configured by setup option (description_folder)
        ├── task1.md    # Memo for task1
        ├── task2.md    # Memo for task2
        ├── task3.md    # Memo for task3
        └── task4.md    # Memo for task4
```

## Usage
Create first kanban project.

`:KanbanCreate <file_path>`

and open kanban to enter `:KanbanOpen <file_path>`.

You can add new tasks with `a` and move cards to focus with `<C-h/j/k/l>`.

You can also move a card with `H/J/K/L`.

See more keymap for information on how to create and move tasks.

In a task card, the first line of text is as the task title, the string beginning with `@` is treated as the deadline, and the characters beginning with `#` are treated as tags.

All setup options are [here](./lua/kanban/ops.lua).

## Format of task cards
![img](./doc/img_kanban2.png)
- First line is **Task title**.
- Line beginning with `#` are **tag**.
- Line beginning with `@` is **due**.

### Optional telescope search
If you installed telescope.nvim, you can search kanban project files by `KanbanOpen telescope` command.

This command search markdown files by `kanban-plugin: .+` which is same options to Obsidian kanban.
